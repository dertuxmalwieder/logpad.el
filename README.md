# logpad.el [![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/logpad-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/logpad)

That one Notepad feature - for GNU Emacs.

## Huh?

A couple of years ago, I wrote [a plug-in](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2775) that would allow me to use Microsoft's [Notepad logging](https://www.howtogeek.com/258545/how-to-use-notepad-to-create-a-dated-log-or-journal-file/) from inside Vim. This is the GNU Emacs variant.

## Installation

`logpad.el` is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/logpad).

## Usage

Enable `(logpad-mode)` and GNU Emacs will check for the magic `.LOG` line whenever you open a text file. For your convenience, this is only happening for new buffers, existing buffers won't be touched.

## Donations (optional)

`logpad.el` is free software by the terms of the [MIT-0 license](LICENSE). As some people - including myself - like to contribute money for a good cause anyway, here are two possible options for you:

### Donate money to the nature:

Both [Kākāpō Recovery](http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/) and the [WWF](https://support.wwf.org.uk/adopt-a-panda) do a pretty good job at trying to keep species alive. You are invited to join their efforts.

### Donate money to me:

Yes, I like money as well.
